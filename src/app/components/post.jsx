      <p>
        On his home soil, after moving through the youth and under-21 ranks,
        Ronaldo had made his first appearance for Portugal’s full national team
        against Kazakhstan in August 2003 (four days after his debut for
        United). He was a key player in Portugal’s fourth-place finish at the
        2006 World Cup and became the full-time captain of the national team in
        2008. In 2012 his stellar play led Portugal to the semifinals of the
        European Championship, where his team was eliminated by rival Spain in a
        match that was decided by a penalty kick shoot-out. Ronaldo came into
        the 2014 World Cup hot off of his second world player of the year win,
        but his play at the tournament was spotty, and the entire Portugal team
        struggled during a group-stage elimination. In 2016 he helped Portugal
        win the European Championship, the country’s first major international
        tournament title, although he only played sparingly in the final because
        of a knee injury that he had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo
        played brilliantly at the 2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four
        games as Portugal advanced to the knockout round only to lose its first
        match of that stage to a strong defensive Uruguay side. Four years later
        Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five different World
        Cups. However, he was not part of the starting lineup for several games,
        and Portugal’s 2022 World Cup ended with a loss in the quarterfinals.
